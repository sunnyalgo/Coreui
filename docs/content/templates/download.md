## Source files

Compile CoreUI Bootstrap Admin with your own asset pipeline by downloading our source Sass, and JavaScript files. This option requires some additional tooling:

- Sass compiler (Libsass or Ruby Sass is supported) for compiling your CSS.
- [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) for CSS vendor prefixing

Should you require [build tools]({{< docsref "/getting-started/build-tools#tooling-setup" >}}), they are included for developing CoreUI for Bootstrap and its docs, but they're likely unsuitable for your own purposes.
